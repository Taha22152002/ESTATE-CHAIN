# Real Estate DApp with Royalty Shareholders DApp

Build and Deploy a Real Estate DApp with Royalty Shareholders Using Solidity and Next.js

Learn how to develop and launch a fully functional Real Estate Decentralized Application (DApp) that allows property listing, buying, and royalty distribution among shareholders. This project uses Solidity to create smart contracts that manage real estate assets and royalty shares, and Next.js to build a modern, responsive frontend interface. You'll implement features like property ownership transfers, royalty payments on every sale, and wallet integrationsâ€”building a complete Web3 real estate platform from scratch to deployment.
